I didn't find it difficult to locate the bugs in this assignment. To be honest, the biggest help was that the source code explicitly pointed them out with comments like "BUG #1". That made the process feel more like I was verifying known issues rather than hunting for hidden ones. But even without those hints, I think simply reading through the code was more effective than actually running the tests. The bugs were standard C mistakes, like hardcoded buffer sizes, which are easy to spot by the comments.

Actually, testing was less reliable in this case because some of the bugs were silent. For instance, in my buffer underflow test, the program didn't crash and even gave the output I expected, yet it was technically accessing invalid memory. If I had only looked at the test results, I would have thought the code was fine. To fix that in the future, I wouldn't rely on just the console output. I would use memory tools like Valgrind that can catch those invisible errors that don't cause an immediate crash.
