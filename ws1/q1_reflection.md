In this workshop, Inspection (Code Walkthrough) was significantly more effective than Testing at identifying bugs.

Why Inspection Was Superior Inspection proved better because many of the bugs in main.c were "silent" errors. For example, in Test #4 (Buffer Underflow), the program output appeared correct (hi does not end with hello), suggesting the code was working. However, a visual inspection of line 36 revealed the pointer arithmetic was accessing invalid memory before the start of the array. Testing failed to catch this because the program didn't crash, whereas inspection identified the critical logic flaw immediately. Additionally, the source code comments (e.g., // BUG #2) made inspection easy compared to designing specific test cases to trigger them.

I would improve the testing technique To improve the testing process. From my experience, testing struggled to catch non-fatal memory errors, I would incorporate dynamic analysis tools like Valgrind. These tools monitor memory usage in real-time and would have immediately flagged the "invisible" buffer underflow as a violation, even if the program output looked correct. Relying solely on console output is insufficient for C programming, from my research testing should be paired with memory instrumentation to be effective for C programming.
